# sharks
I read a book that mentioned studying sharks and shark attacks and I got curious..... so here we are.

Data is from http://www.sharkattackdata.com/ - June 29, 2020

Mary Roach's book on military science, Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War was the book I read (and reccommend).

May do data viz in Tableau and share to Tableau Public, or may do in Python.
